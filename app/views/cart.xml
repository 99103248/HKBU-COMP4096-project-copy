<!-- 
This page should display the items from database, based on the ID's that we've added. 
Maybe this page can be a temporary storage page. So everytime you open the app this page will be blank, but once we add items from within the app it saves it here. 
'BUY' Button at the bottom which if you click it sums up all the prices from the items (stored in DB) and than displays total amount.  -->
